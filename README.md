This repository contains the code for the _Beginning TypeScript_ book.

It shows how to integrate TypeScript into a JavaScript project by using JSDoc comment to add types in the `.js` files.

You can run the compilation process from the terminal using TypeScript:

```sh
tsc
```

The output will be in the `dist/` folder.
